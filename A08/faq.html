    <p class="question">What product is taking up the most space in US landfills?</p>
    <div class="answer_wrapper">
      <p class="answer">The item most frequently encountered in MSW landfills is plain old paper -- on average, it accounts for more than 40% of a landfill's contents. This proportion has held steady for decades and in some landfills has actually risen. Newspapers alone can take up as much as 13% of the space in US landfills.<br><br>Organic materials, including paper, do not easily biodegrade once they are disposed of in a landfill. Paper is many times more resistant to deterioration when compacted in a landfill than when it is in open contact with the atmosphere. Research by William Rathje, who runs the Garbage Project, has shown that, when excavated from a landfill, newspapers from the 1960s can be intact and readable.</p>
