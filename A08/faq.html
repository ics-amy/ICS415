      <p class="question" id="q1"><b>Can eating a poppy seed bagel cause you to fail a drug test?</b></p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer_wrapper" id="googlefont_answer">
      <p class="answer" id="a1">Yes, ingestion of poppy seed bagels or poppy seed cake can indeed cause a false positive on a urine test for opiates.Ingestion of poppy seeds can result in a positive drug test as long as two days after ingestion.

      <p class="question" id="q2"><b>What product is taking up the most space in US landfills?</b></p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer_wrapper" id="googlefont_answer">
      <p class="answer" id="a2">The item most frequently encountered in MSW landfills is plain old paper -- on average, it accounts for more than 40% of a landfill's contents. This proportion has held steady for decades and in some landfills has actually risen. Newspapers alone can take up as much as 13% of the space in US landfills.<br><br>Organic materials, including paper, do not easily biodegrade once they are disposed of in a landfill. Paper is many times more resistant to deterioration when compacted in a landfill than when it is in open contact with the atmosphere. Research by William Rathje, who runs the Garbage Project, has shown that, when excavated from a landfill, newspapers from the 1960s can be intact and readable.</p>

      <p class="question" id="q3"><b>Where are the world’s two largest ice sheets and why is NASA studying them?</b></p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer_wrapper" id="googlefont_answer">
      <p class="answer" id="a3">The two largest ice sheets are in Greenland and Antarctica. Together, they contain 75% of the world’s fresh water. If all this ice melted back into the ocean it would raise sea level by over 75 meters. This would change Earth’s surface in a big way: large areas of the continents would be flooded! This is why Earth scientists use satellites to measure the ice levels on Greenland and Antarctica to see if they are growing or shrinking.</p>

    <div class="question_wrapper" id="googlefont_question">
      <p class="question" id="q4"><b>What is the NSA Domestic Spying Program?</b></p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer_wrapper" id="googlefont_answer">
      <p class="answer" id="a4">Sometime in 2001, the president authorized the NSA to intercept telephone and Internet communications of Americans inside the United States, without the authorization of any law or court. Under the program, the NSA is intercepting and analyzing millions of ordinary Americans’ communications, with the help of the country’s largest phone and Internet companies. The president has stated that he authorized the domestic spying in 2001, that he has reauthorized the program more than 30 times since its inception, and intends to continue doing so.</p>

      <p class="question" id="q5"><b>Why are Goths depressed?</b></p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer_wrapper" id="googlefont_answer">
      <p class="answer" id="a5">Not all Goths are depressed, just as not all cheerleaders are airheads, not all nerds are ugly, not all surfers are bums with long blond hair. These are stereotypes, which are often very harmful to other people. Granted, some Goths are depressed, but so are non-Goths. There is no empirical data that suggests that people who are involved in Goth culture are more depressed than people involved in any other culture.</p>
